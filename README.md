# Exemplar
> Write Once, Explain Clearly: Powerful Doctests Examples for Everyone
> 
> ⚠️ This project is currently in its initial stages. We welcome contributions and collaboration from the Python community!

## Overview

Exemplar is a Python project aiming to standardize and improve the creation of code examples within documentation, particularly focusing on doctests. Our goal is to make code documentation clearer, more user-friendly, and ultimately empower developers of all experience levels.

## Motivation

High-quality examples are crucial for understanding code libraries and their functionalities. However, documentation examples can often be inconsistent, incomplete, or lack clarity. This can be a barrier to entry for newcomers and a source of frustration for experienced developers.

Some benefits of good examples include:
* **Reduced Learning Curve:** Clear and well-documented examples lower the barrier to entry for new users of Python libraries.
* **Improved Retention:** Users gain a deeper understanding of code functionality through practical examples.
* **Enhanced Collaboration:** Consistent and well-documented examples facilitate better collaboration among developers.
* **Streamlined Development:** Standardized example creation saves time and effort for developers.

## Exemplar's Approach
* **Standardization:** Define best practices for creating clear, informative, and well-structured code examples within documentation.
* **Doctest Integration:** Leverage doctests to seamlessly integrate executable examples within documentation, ensuring their accuracy and relevance.
* **Measurable Quality:** Develop metrics and tools to evaluate the comprehensiveness and clarity of code examples.
* **Broader Applicability:** While initially focusing on NumPy, the project aims to create a framework applicable to various Python libraries.
